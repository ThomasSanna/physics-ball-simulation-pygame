# Ball Simulation Project

Welcome to the Ball Simulation Project! This Python project uses the `pygame` library to simulate interactive balls and circles with physics, collisions, and visual effects. The project is designed for experimentation, learning, and fun, and is inspired by viral physics simulations often seen on platforms like TikTok.

## Features

- **Physics Engine:** Realistic movement, collision detection, and response for balls and circles.
- **Multiple Entities:** Includes classes for balls, circles, walls, particles, and more.
- **Visual Effects:** Colorful graphics, particle effects, and smooth animations.
- **Sound Integration:** MIDI music playback for immersive experiences.
- **Pause Menu:** In-game menu for pausing and resuming the simulation.
- **Customizable Assets:** Easily swap icons, images, and sounds from the `assets/` folder.
- **Extensible:** Modular codebase for adding new features or entities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- `pygame` library

Install `pygame` using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Simulation

Run the main simulation file:

```
python mainRondCercle.py
```

You can also explore other scripts for different simulation modes:

- `couleurVScouleur.py`
- `doubleSortie.py`
- `Escape.py`
- `yesorno.py`
- `maintest.py`

### Folder Structure

- `classs/`: Core classes for entities, physics, and game logic.
- `assets/`: Icons, images, and sound files.
- `prefSounds/` & `testSounds/`: MIDI music files for background soundtracks.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts and helpers.

## TikTok Inspiration

Physics simulations like this have become popular on TikTok, where creators showcase mesmerizing ball interactions, chain reactions, and satisfying animations. This project aims to capture that viral energy and make it easy for anyone to create their own TikTok-worthy simulations.

Feel free to share your creations on TikTok and tag the project!

## Customization

- Add new images or sounds to the `assets/` folder.
- Modify or extend classes in `classs/` to create new entities or behaviors.
- Change MIDI files in `prefSounds/` and `testSounds/` for different music.
